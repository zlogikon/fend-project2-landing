# Landing Page Project

This project was created as part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.

The project included a set of HTML and CSS files. It was my task to create the following functionality using JavaScript and minimal changes to the HTML and CSS.

<ul>
  <li>Generate a navigation menu that will remain on screen and smoothly scroll to each section</li>
  <li>Highlight which section is in the viewport and reflect that in the navigation menu</li>
  <li>Create a button to return to the top</li>
  <li>JavaScript should be adaptable as the page content changes</li>
</ul>
